// Primitive data Types
/*
seven categories of primitive data types.
primitive data are called by values not reference.
1. string ("Hitesh")
2. Number (10)
3. Boolean (true)
4. Null (null)
5. Undefined ()
6. Symbol (used to make a value unique):
    id = Symbol('123')
    id2 = Symbol('123')
    id === id2 -> false
    both refer to different value


7. BigInt (values greater than number | rarely used) (12313213212n)
*/


// Reference Data Type or Non Primitive data Types
/*
these are called by reference in memory not actual copy of data
1. Arrays ([1,2,3])
2. Objects ({"Name" : "Hitesh", "age" : 20, "id" = 1})
3. Functions ()=> {
    // do something
    }
*/

// Javascript is a Dynamically types language which means we dont need to define data type at the time of declaring a variable.
